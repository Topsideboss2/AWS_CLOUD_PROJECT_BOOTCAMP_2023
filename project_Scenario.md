## Project Scenario

A startup company has decided to build their own micro-blogging platform and has hired you to be its first cloud engineer.
The company paid a web-development firm ti translate their wireframe designs into a mock web-application for the purpose of demoing to raise capital.
After a successfil round of funding, you (the cloud engineer) have been tasked with taking the mock web-application and making it production ready at scale.
The startup company consulted a fractional CTO to help choose some of the technical  requirements to place the company on a good technical roadmap.

* The frontend application should be written in Javascript using React(functional components).
* The backend application should be written in Python using Flask:
	* Since we plan to be API only
	* Since we want to choose a popular framework API only framework
	* Since we want a micro=framework because we are offloading as much 		to the cloud as possible to avoid a monolithic application
	* Since we don't want an ORM because the CTO considers anti-pattern
	* Since Python is the most popular language being learned for cloud 		right now
* That an API specification be defined detailing the exact endpoints required.
* The web application:
	* Shall be deployed to AWS
	* Takes advantage of modern-applications cloud services.

The startup company has spent the majority of their funding hiring you for the next 6 months (but mostly spent the money on marketing and buying a really cool domain) and so you also need to ensure you keep the cloud provider costs as low as possible.

Good luck!
